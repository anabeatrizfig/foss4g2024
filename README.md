This paper explores the benefits of transitioning to a hybrid approach by integrating Python and open-source geospatial libraries into the data processing phase of geospatial analysis. By presenting the possible advantages gained and providing a hands-on example of Python use in geospatial data, the aim of this paper is to demonstrate how Python can play a pivotal role in overcoming the limitations of no-code solutions.
